This will "download" (actually copy) a playlist from plex to a different local folder. Assuming your computer and plex have the same network share mounted, although at different directories. It's written for linux, but you can problably get it to work for windows? See --help for instructions.

# Dev Notes
* You can set the help pager by doing `PAGER=cat ./plex-list-downloader.py`
